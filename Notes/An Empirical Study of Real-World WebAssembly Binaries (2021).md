# An Empirical Study of Real-World WebAssembly Binaries (2021)

## Contributions
- The first comprehensive study of WebAssembly binaries gathered from multiple sources, including client-side web applications, package managers, and source code repositories;
- A combination of automated program analyses, manual inspection, and statistical analysis to answer research questions about the security, source languages, and use cases of WebAssembly;
- Empirical evidence and insights about security-related properties of real-world WebAssembly, some of which update earlier findings and many of which call for future work on mitigation techniques and analysis tools;
- By far the largest benchmark of WebAssembly binaries, which we make available as a basis for other studies and as a benchmark for future tools: https://github.com/solast/WasmBench
